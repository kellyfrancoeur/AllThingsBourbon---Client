                                    <p>If you’re interested in the economic history of bourbon, this is just the book for you. In “Bourbon Empire: The Past and Future of America's Whiskey,” author Reid Mitenbuler examines the intricacies of politics, organized crime, capitalism, people, and craftsmanship that have shaped the bourbon category over time.</p>
                                    <p>Of course, the past generally serves as some sort of indication of the present and future of an industry, and Mitenbuler’s words on the future of the bourbon business are nothing if not compelling. This book helps to pull the curtain back on bourbon storytelling, which is often romanticized by those who sell it.</p>

                                    <p>While there are probably too many whiskey books with the word “bible” in the title, this one actually puts its money where its mouth is thanks to author Eric Zandona’s sharp and pointed take on the bourbon industry through his dissection of 140 different bourbons.</p>
                                    <p>Zandona, who works as the Director of Spirits Information at the American Distilling Institute, profiles each bourbon individually and includes key facts alongside aroma and tasting notes; he also shares 20 cocktail recipes within the book, all while acknowledging the impact of colonization and slave ownership on the industry. Consider your sipping, mixing, and educational endeavors covered.</p>

                                    <p>Cooking with bourbon is not for the faint of heart, nor is baking, which is perhaps more of a science than simply pouring a few ounces of the spirit into a bisque. In “The Best Bourbon Cookbook: Booze-Infused Sweet & Savory Recipes,” author Christina Tosch lays out recipe after recipe for both savory dishes and various desserts alongside a few easy-to-make cocktails. This book is self-published but is widely available for purchase online.</p>
